"""x402 auto-pay — the feature that turns a wallet into autonomy.

Without this, an agent with a wallet is an agent with a piggy bank. With it,
an agent hits a paywalled API, pays, and carries on — no human in the loop.

    from stipend.x402 import fetch
    response = fetch("https://api.example.com/expensive-thing")

How the protocol works, in one paragraph: the server answers `402 Payment
Required` with a base64 `PAYMENT-REQUIRED` header describing what it wants.
The client signs an **EIP-3009 `transferWithAuthorization`** — a gasless USDC
authorisation — and retries with a `PAYMENT-SIGNATURE` header. A facilitator
verifies the signature, submits it on-chain, and pays the gas. The agent never
needs ETH, and the server never holds a private key.

IMPORTANT — what is verified and what is not:
  * EIP-3009 is a settled standard and the signing here follows it exactly.
    The EIP-712 domain is read FROM THE TOKEN CONTRACT at runtime rather than
    hardcoded, so it cannot drift from whatever USDC actually expects.
  * The public x402 spec is incomplete on header encoding details. This
    implementation follows the documented shape, but INTEROP IS UNVERIFIED
    until tested against a live x402 server. Do not treat a passing self-test
    as proof it works against a real merchant.

Every payment goes through the same policy checks as a manual payout. An
injected "just pay this" from a hostile web page cannot exceed the caps, and
cannot reach a destination outside the allowlist.
