"""Anonymous usage counting.

We need to know how many installs exist — without it there is nothing to show a
merchant and no way to tell whether this is working. But this is a product whose
entire pitch is that it doesn't leak your money or your data, so the bar is high.

What is sent:
  * a random install id, generated locally, tied to nothing
  * the version, the chain name (base / base-sepolia)
  * counts: how many payments, how many x402 calls
  * coarse spend buckets, NOT amounts

What is never sent — and there is no code path that could:
  * wallet addresses, private keys, the passphrase
  * counterparties, URLs, transaction hashes
  * exact amounts, balances, or anything joinable back to a person

Disclosed on first run, one line to turn off, and the payload is printable
before it is sent (`stipend telemetry show`). If you would not be comfortable
publishing the payload, it should not be in here.
